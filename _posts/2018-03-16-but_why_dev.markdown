The lead-up to my dive into this coding program wasn't very exciting, but it sure was long. 

I worked for a coffee company for about four years, leading their in-house bakery operations to serve about 12 cafes on the East Coast from a commissary kitchen in Brooklyn, NY. The wonderful thing about this company was their dedication to having a full team of developers in-house creating digital tools for their coffee production team, which helped them build efficiencies and minimize waste. Ideally, we would have had these same tools for the culinary team, but since coffee and food are two very different animals when it comes to production style, it was a challenge to find the right solution.

I did a LOT of demos of software, most of which looked like it had been created in about 1993. A lot of these clearly meant well but were ugly, clunky and difficult to navigate. I spoke with a couple of our engineers about linking one of these programs to our own tools, and through months and months of meetings it became clear this was probably impossible.

This is why I say the lead-up wasn't very exciting--there were many months of trying, stopping, trying again, hitting a wall, rethinking, and so on. I built tools in Excel and Google Sheets that imitated what I wanted for my kitchen team, but those were clunky too.

Finally, this led me to sit back and think: how do these tools work? Where would I even begin to learn about web development? And beyond that, what are the possibilities for web development in the food industry overall? Are there tools out there waiting to be built that could help connect people through food, reduce waste, make our kitchens more efficient, and more?

I took many steps back and started with a free HTML/CSS class on Codecademy, and fell in love. On the advice of a few developer friends and co-workers, I started to learn JavaScript and some Ruby. Over three months, I took another, broader intensive through Codecademy, sat in on many bootcamp talks, thought about simply teaching myself, and got very overwhelmed with the sheer breadth of options out there for someone to learn programming.

Thankfully, I ended up here--I knew I couldn't take three months off work to do a bootcamp (who can??). I finally found the Flatiron part-time program and applied, still feeling like such a baby in this world and like I would never get in, let alone on a scholarship for women programmers. But hey--I really worked to get here and I'm so happy I did.

From here, I hope to find what I originally set out to and figure out the best way to marry my new skills with my long-time ones. I hope it's still food-related, since I truly believe there is an intersection between our digital world and our food systems that has yet to be explored.

But I am open to what this journey brings.
